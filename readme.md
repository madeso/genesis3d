# Genesis3d OO

I think the genesis 3d is the greatest 3d API I ever used and I like my rendering API to have the same "greatness". A lot has changed since I used it in 2001-2005 and the graphical landscape has changed much. The original was in C and using C conventions in a object oriented style.

The aim of this small project is to "convert" the public API, and headers only, to a more c++ objected oriented style and 100% ignoring memory management. Along the way converting the comments to a doxygen compatible style.

The goal will not end up in a useful product that one can run or even compile, it's just for exploration and admiration.
